title: Fifth week with Software Engineering
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
My partner and I completed project two early so the week was all about Career Fair. We had an awesome alumni came to talk to us and his presentation was mind-blowing. I could not say how much I was inspired from what they did and are doing. We also had new class materials and they’re much more interesting than the weeks before. We optimized some functions and the result was so ”beautiful”.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I’ve been taking the class for a month and the difficulty is pretty higher. I still forget to use lambda in many cases so I'll try to practice more. Optimization is still a big problem for me.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I'll continue focus on learning Python and JavaScript. I should clear all the confusions to prepare for the mid-term well. I'm having some interviews in the next couple weeks and I hope I could perform well during those interviews, using what I got from this class.

The more I learn the more I love Python though like Professor Downing said it's not a safe language. It's easier to understand and implement to compare with Java and C++ (for sure, I'm still scared of C++ preferences and pointers). Many friends of mine said that it’s easier to use Python to code during the interview except when the interviewers ask us to use a specific language and it’s true. I tried in two interview meetings and I could focus on the algorithm better than before.

<i>Tip of the week: </i> “Don’t forget to review definitions, basic concepts when you’re going to the interviews.”
