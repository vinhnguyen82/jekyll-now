title: Software Engineering - Week twelve
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
We were working on phase three of the project with the incomplete phase two because we still had problem scrapping database from RESTful APIs. The skeleton of the website was completed and we hope we could finish everything soon. I was learning Reacts as long as PostgreSQL, not only for the project but also for my career.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Scrapping database from the RESTful APIs seems to be the biggest problem for us now. All of us are newbies to that part so it’s costing us so much time.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Our job next week is to finish scrapping all the required database, optimize our models and the website to fulfill the project’s requirements. I’m preparing for the most important interview so far and I hope I will succeed and have a good start for my career.

In class this week we learned about refactoring in Java. The examples are already there but I needs time to “digest” and "memorize" them clearly. And the quizzes are really tricky by pointing into the critical points of the examples and that’s the reason on which I lost many points. Right now, the lectures in class and the examples are extremely helpful for me while I’m in interviews with couples companies and the questions are always about object-oriented programming’s four corner stones, abstraction, interface, static classes,…

<i>Tips of the week: </i> “Never be dependent on any individual in work or you would suffer lateness or failure.”
