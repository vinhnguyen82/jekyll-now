title: Fourth week with Software Engineering
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
I completed project 2's coding with my partner very soon, just one day after the project released so we will have lots of time to prepare for the Career Fair next week. We also learned new material in class. We had Chris Martin from Bloomberg as guest speaker and his presentation was so inspiring and wonderful.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I'm still learning Python and completing the project's requirements. I'm still e beginner to Python and it's a bad story.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I'll continue focus on learning Python and JavaScript. The College of Natural Science career fair is on Tuesday and I hope to get couple opportunities there thought I don't expect much.

I feel more confident this week and I learned many new stuffs. It's a long time and I'm have the pair programming again. And like Professor Downing said, it's extremely useful and effective. Using one monitor and one keyboard, we could quickly find out the way to solve the problem and build the effective algorithm for the project. We also found out the bugs and typos in really quickly. My partner is quite smart and intelligent and I learned a lot from her, not only from her academic knowledge, her coding style but also her characteristics. Although I'm not a hard-to-talk-to person, I think I should be more open-minded to people around me so that I could learn more. The Career Fair is on Tuesday and I don't expect much from that. Besides some good companies, I feel that many companies come there only to show off. We'll see what could I get this time.

<i>Tip of the week: </i> “A closed mind is like a closed book; just a block of wood.”
