title: Second week with Software Engineering
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
I finished installing all required tools and Docker VM for the projects, and learned
more about JavaScript and felt more confident about Python. I'm more familiar
with the tools and Professor Downing's requirements.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Meta cache is really difficult to implement. I think I need to learn much more about Python.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I'll try to complete the project early and have more time for the class new material.
Indeed, I'll spend more time to learn Python and JavaScript.<br>
