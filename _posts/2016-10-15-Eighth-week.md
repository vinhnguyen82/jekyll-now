title: Eighth week with Software Engineering
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
We've been working on the new project after forming a wonderful team. We were discussing of many ideas and came up with Mythology which we think is new and interesting. We'll give a snapshot of Gods, Heroes, Titans and their stories in the Greek Mythology on the website greekmethology.me.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
It's the first time I'm using bootstrap and react, so it's consuming me lot of time but we are doing great and everything is on the track of completing on time and in style. So there is currently no problem when I can always get help from my awesome teammates.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I'll continue to work on completing the project and its further phases as far as possible. And as usual, I’ll keep learning Python and prepare myself for some interviews next week. I’m on the GUI and front end team so I’m concentrating on using Bootstrap, JavaScript and Reacts but I’m trying to involve in the back end work so I could learn more.

There’s not much to say this week. In class, we talked about the project and we learned about Decorator which is so beautiful and I think it's very useful. I didn’t answer this week quizzes well and I got a zero for the first time, and it is like a kick on my teeth. I attended a funeral this weekend and didn’t spend much time on the project until Sunday night but I have a wonderful teammate who spent time to explain to me the project’s progress and showed me how to do my part of the job smoothly. It’s gonna be a very busy week ahead and I’ll put two hundred percent of my effort to have all the jobs done.
