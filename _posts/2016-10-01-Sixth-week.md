title: Sixth week with Software Engineering
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
We had a great week with a lot of new class materials like yield, generator, comprehension and iterator. They were sometime confused. I thought that I understood them clearly but I didn't and I got really bad grades on the quizzes.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I'm still a little confused about how yield and generator work in some cases, and I hope I could understand them clearly before the mid-term next Thursday. Time is sufficient since I have many interviews through the weeks and need a lot of time to prepare.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I will review to understand all class materials and prepare well for the mid-term next week, especially the ones of the last two weeks. And I will continue focus on learning Python and JavaScript as usual.

I feel that the quizzes were so tricky and you would lose points easily if don’t pay extreme attention. But after all, the class is always helpful to me and help me build the habit of being more concentrated though I don’t know for sure if the material will be useful for my future jobs. I'm having some interviews next week and it takes me a lot of time to prepare for those appointments. It will be an intense week a head to overcome.
