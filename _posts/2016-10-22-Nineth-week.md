title: Nineth week with Software Engineering
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
We completed the project's website. I learned many new stuffs, like Bootstrap, SQL, how to set up Digital Ocean, how to set up a new website's database and how to query through the database. Those new stuffs are so interesting and so useful. I'm addicted to Bootstrap now I cannot wait to use it on my new personal website.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
We still have some issues with the website and I'm not quite satisfied with it. I think we need to make a lot of changes for the second phase which dues in two weeks. New material which are necessary for the project are tremendous and took so much of my time, since I had to learn a lot to understand what my teammates are doing and help them in some ways. I hope that would pay me off in the near future.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I'll continue to work on the project and make it as complete as possible. I have some interviews next week and I hope I can have enough time to help my teammates in both front end and back end and have a better contribution to the project. And as usual, I’ll keep learning Python and JavaScript.

In class, we learned about how to write unit tests and how to query the database. And I'm figuring how to apply them into my current unit tests of the project. Phase one of the project consumed much more time than we expected as we need to spend time on new tools and new setting-ups. I hope the next phase will not cost us such much time and we can focus on engineer the website instead of the tools and environments.
