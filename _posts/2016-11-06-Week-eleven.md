title: Software Engineering - Week eleven
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
We were working on phase two of the project. I especially learned more about Bootstrap and Reacts for the front end requirements. One of my teammates dropped the class, and since she was a very important member, that affected our plan pretty much. The past week began with a mess. Our project was delayed cause many of us were busy with the interviews out of state, one dropped the class, others were busy with midterms, etc … But we put all the pieces together at the end and finished the project on time. I hope all of us got a good lesson on how to put our effort on the work and contribute more for the project.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
We are all new to Reacts and Bootstrap so we’re learning on the way of building our website, so it took us most of the time. Also, we still have problem on scrapping the database from the Restful APIs so right now the website is not as good as we expect. We hope we could resolve it in the coming week.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Our job nexk week is to finish scrapping all the required database and to optimize the website to fulfill the project’s requirements.

In class this week we learned about SQL. It’s very basic and not very hard to understand. The examples are so obvious and illustrate the material very well. And with Downing’s effort in class, I have no doubt that everyone could master the basic SQL knowledge easily.
