title: Third week with Software Engineering
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
I completed project 1 just a couple minutes before deadline. It was not because I started the project late or I couldn't optimize the program. It was technical integrity problem with Travis CI and GitHub test repository. Besides, we had a short but interested week with Python's list and tuple and their complicated features.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I'm still learning about Travis CI's and GitHub's integrity to avoid future technical problems that could lead to projects' failures. And I'm still digesting new class material.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
As usual, I'll continue focus on learning Python and JavaScript. The more I learn Python, the more I love it. I wish I had studied it hard enough before and hope it’s not too late to learn it.

I got a thrilled week with Project 1. Albert and some friends in class were extremely helpful and I couldn’t make it without their helps. I thought that implementing the project using meta-cache was more difficult but it was not. To me, the problem was the project’s integrity with Sphere and Travis CI. I was naive to forget importing sys and main() to the Sphere file and it took me almost the whole day to find out the problem. Then, I had the problem with the makefile which took me another day, until minutes before the deadline, to get it. Though I’m not care much about the grading, I found it difficult to see that I almost fail the project because of my “stupid” mistake. I had the problem before but didn’t pay attention enough back then. Now I learned the mistake and I hope it won’t happen again.
