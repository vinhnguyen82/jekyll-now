title: Software Engineering - The last week
---
Overall, Software Engineering is one of the best classes of the CS Department.
And Professor Downing is a great lecturer, as usual. The class was well organized
and the lectures were well scheduled so that you'll understand them easily if you
pay enough attention. During his lectures, Professor Downing also gave us some
useful tricks, ideas for job interviews and I really appreciate that.

I think daily quizzes were the most annoying part of the class. They
were sometimes so tricky that if you mistake only a single word, you'll lose your points.
But through the quizzes I can say that you'll understand the covered material much much better.

The projects were not very difficult. Some projects just took us couple hours to finish but the
integration part was a different story to me. You need to pass Travis CI's test, you need to pass Sphere
or other online judges, and personally this work cost me most of the time. Sometimes I got stuck
for hours, even one or two days, to fix very tiny mistakes. But after that, you'll feel
more experienced and face it easily. And don't forget your pizza, I meant Piazza, it's very
useful and helpful place where you can mostly get the answers for your problems since you have
many people working on the same or similar work. And don't forget to say "thank you" to the helper,
Gratitude is a luxury thing to many CS students from what I saw.

The tests were not very difficult but pretty long to me. You have to work on six or seven questions
that sometimes it took time to organize the solutions. Once again, if you pay enough attention in class,
you would know what will be on the tests without looking at the Rubric posted on Canvas.

Finally, taking Software Engineering class was one of the best choices I've ever made
during my time at UT and so do you.
