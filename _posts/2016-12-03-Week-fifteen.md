title: Software Engineering - The last week
---
Overall, Software Engineering is one of the best classes of the CS Department.
And Professor Downing is a great lecturer, as usual. The class was well organized
and the lectures were well scheduled so that you'll understand them easily if you
pay enough attention.
Daily quizzes are the most annoying part of the class. They
were sometimes so tricky that if you mistake only a single word, you'll lose your points.
But through the quizzes I can say that you'll understand the covered material much much better.

The projects are not very difficult. Some projects just took us couple hours to finish but the
integration part was a different story. You'll need to pass Travis CI, you need to pass Sphere or
other online judge, and personally this work cost me most of the time. Sometimes I got stuck
for hours or even one or two days without finding the solutions. But after that, you'll feel
more experienced and face it easily. And don't forget your pizza, I meant Piazza, it's very
useful and helpful place where you can mostly get the answers for your problems since you have
many people working on the same or similar work. And don't forget to say "thank you" to the helper.
