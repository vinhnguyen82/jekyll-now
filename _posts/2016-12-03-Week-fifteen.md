title: Software Engineering - The last week
---
Overall, Software Engineering is one of the best classes of the CS Department.
And Professor Downing is a great lecturer, as usual. The class was well organized
and the lectures were well scheduled so that you'll understand them easily if you
pay enough attention. Daily quizzes are the most annoying part of the class. They
were sometimes so tricky that if you mistake only a single word, you'll lose your points.
