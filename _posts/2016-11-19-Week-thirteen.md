title: Software Engineering - Week thirteen
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
We finished building the website for the project. It works beautifully and every function works as required and expected. My teammates worked very hard on the last two days and we finally worked like a real team. There were no divisions between front end or back end and everyone worked two hundred percents of their normal abilities. I did not only learn more about JavaScript and also understand more about my teammates.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
We are working on visualization and critiques of our and another group's websites for the presentation. Time is a problem as we have to present on Monday.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Not many things to do next week beside the presentation on Monday since we'll have almost a full week off for Thanksgiving. And since it seemed I was failed in the interview last week, I have to spend more time to apply for jobs.

This week we learned about dynamic binding and continued on strategy pattern in Java. And once again it's very helpful to recall class inheritance, abstraction and interface. It helped me clear more confuses and I can not thank Professor Downing enough for giving me a broader and better vision about those mechanisms. This week was not a very good one and I'm not getting the job I love but I won't stop and I'll try again next time.
