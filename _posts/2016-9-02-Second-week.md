title: Second week with Software Engineering
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
I finished installing all required tools and Docker VM for the projects, learned more about JavaScript and felt more confident about Python. I was more familiar with the tools and Professor Downing's requirements.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
While the lazy cache and eager cache are simple and easy to implement, the meta cache is really difficult to implement. And I still have problem with Travis CI and Sphere. In addition, I think I need to learn much more about Python cause I didn't learn Python the hard way.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I will try to complete the project early and have more time for the class new material and my own mobile app, which should be finished before the CNS Career Fair so I can show the recruiters my work. Indeed, I'll spend more time to learn Python and JavaScript.<br>

I like the teaching style of professor Downing. He always makes the class interesting and full of new useful elements. The class was more attractive this week as we had the project one posted and new class material. I talked with some friends in class and they made me feel more comfortable and less "anti-social". I think the project is not complicated but with the required optimization, it is going to take us a lot of time. I could make the lazy cache and eager cache work. I'm implementing the meta cache but it does not work yet, and I'm having problem of the integrity on Travis CI. I will spend the weekend to finish it or I will try to optimize other ways.<br>

<i>Tip of the week:</i> Stay focused and believe in yourself then the world will recognize your abilities and talent.
