title: Seventh week with Software Engineering

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
We had new interesting class material this week and a pretty hard test. The Itertool and function unpacking are very impressive and powerful. And I’ve been studying hard for the test over the week.

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
After the test, I think that I knowledge about Python is still so limited. Even I’ve been learning hard for the test, I felt difficult to fulfill the test’s requirements. Maybe I need to try harder on Python.

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I’m preparing for the last three projects by concentrating on JavaScript and Restful APIs. I hope I could get a lot out of those projects. And as usual, I’ll keep learning Python and prepare myself for some interviews next week.

The test’s instructions and hints were so helpful to me and the hint saved me once. Besides, the Canvas editor is so bad that it has no “Tab” function so I had to type the “Space Bar” so many times for indents and it was really annoying and took me the precious test time. I felt like the test was pretty long and I had no time to double check my work. But overall, I think the test is fair and reasonable. And class materials are extremely helpful for Downing’s tests.
