title: First week with Software Engineering
---

Many friends of mine told me that Software Engineering is one of the most interesting classes that we should take before graduating though it's very intensive and takes lots of time. And it's true. The class is interesting since the first day, even more interesting than the Object-Oriented Programming class I took last year. I'm familiar with professor Downing's teaching style so it didn't surprise me much, but I'm still anxious when he calls out students' names to answer his questions. Two most important things I got this week is the answer to what "if __name__ = __main__" does, and the importance of using unit tests. And I believe it would help improving my coding style a lot. The weeks ahead will be very intensive and I hope I could do it well till the end of the semester.
