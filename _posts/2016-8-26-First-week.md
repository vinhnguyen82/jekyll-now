title: First week with Software Engineering
---

<b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
I finished installing all required tools and VM, and I learnt more about Python and a little about Docker VM.<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Docker VM is new so I need more time to be familiar with it.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I'll spend more time to learn Python and JavaScript, as well as how to use coverage, pylint, autopeep8 and Docker VM effectively.<br>

Many friends of mine told me that Software Engineering is one of the most interesting classes that we should take before graduating from UT though it's very intensive and takes lots of time. And it's true. The class itself is not hard, the requirements for the projects makes the class complicated and intensive, but I think when we are familiar with them we'll be better off in the near future. The class is interesting since the first day, even it seems more interesting than the Object-Oriented Programming class I took last year. I'm familiar with professor Downing's teaching style so it didn't surprise me much, but I'm still a little nervous when he calls out students' names to answer his questions because I'm not good at speaking among the crowd.

The class needs many tools to be installed and set up and it took me lots of time, especially Docker VM. I'm still learning all the needed tools hard to be more familiar with them. Two most important things I got this week is the answer to what "if ____name____ == ____main____" does, and the importance of using unit tests. And I believe it would help improving my coding style a lot. Right now my concern is how to use the tools correctly and effectively. The weeks ahead will be very intensive and I hope I could do it well till the end of the semester.
